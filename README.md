# NextJS Starter

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcoffee-cup%2Fnext-starter)

This is my goto starter for new NextJS projects. It has

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Twin](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) for styling
- Light/dark modes
- [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) for analytics
- Simple page/layout structure

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site

```bash
# Install deps
yarn

# Start development server
yarn dev
```
